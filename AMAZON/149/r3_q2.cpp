Given a log file of page visits of a website by different users for a day.

Entry in the log file is like this:
User 1 visited Page 4
User 3 visited Page 2
User 7 visited Page 9
.
.
.

Design an efficient data structure which supports queries like the following:
Which page was visited by exactly 2 users in day?
Which page was visited by only one user exactly 2 times in a day?
Which page was visited by â€˜User 3? more than 5 times in a day?

Design Overview
struct page
{       map <int , node * > m;
        node *head, *tail;
        page()
        {       head=tail=NULL; }
};

This is a structure which contains detailsof users on each page
Each user detail is represented by a node in a LL
LL + Map concept
m[user] -> node

struct node
{	node *next;
	int user, int count;
}

so structure
For page P->
page[P] :  {user1,visits_by_user1} -> {user3,visits_by_user1} -> {user5,visits_by_user1} -> {user2,visits_by_user1}
	      |												|
	     head										      tail
	     m[user1]			m[user3]			m[user5]]		   m[user2]

Similarly for each page x page[x] contains the details
Details of page P by user X -> O(1)

Another DLL+Map for visits_on_page and page
