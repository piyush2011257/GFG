Convert an integer to its roman. He asked me to consider cases with integers containing 4 and 9. I didnâ€™t understand properly.

Corner case of 4 and 9
I 	The numeral one. II is two, III is three. You seldom see IIII as 4, since IV can also mean 4, plus its shorter to write.
V 	The numeral 5. IV is 4, VI is 6, VII is 7, VIII is 8.
X 	The numeral 10. IX is 9, XI is 11, etc.
L 	The numeral 50. XL would be 40.
C 	The numeral 100. Think of Century having a hundred years. C is short for the Latin word Centum, but that's not very easy to remember.
D 	The numeral 500.
M 	The numeral 1000.


For 1 - 49999

I II III
IV	( 1(I) less than 5(V) )
V VI VII VIII
IX	( 1(I) less than 10(X) )
X

X XX XXX	10-30
XL		( 10(X) less than 50 (L) )
L LX LXX LXXX	50-80
XC		( 10(X) less than 100 (C) )
C		100

C CC CCC	100-300
CD		400 ( 100(C) less than 500 (D) )
D DC DCC DCCC	500-800
CM		900
M		1000 ( 100(C) less than 1000 (M) )

This symmetry everywhere
M MM MMM MMMM MMMMM MMMMMMM MMMMMMM...  ( 1000 -> 9000 )
