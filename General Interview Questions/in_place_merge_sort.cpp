The recursive base case, as usual, is the array of length one (or zero):  first>=last.

Otherwise, compute a mid-point (mid=(first+last)/2;), and then recursively sort the data from first up through  mid, and from mid+1 up through last.

inPlaceSort (x, first,  mid);
inPlaceSort (x, mid+1, last);

The slightly tricky part is the merge logic.  As usual, you have a subscript into the left array segment (x[left]) and the right array segment (x[right]).  If x[left] tests as less than or equal to x[right], then it is already in place within the sorted array segment, so just increment left.  Otherwise, the array element in x[right] needs to move down into the space currently occupied by x[left], and to accommodate this, the entire array segment from x[left] through x[right-1] needs to move up by one â€” effectively you need to rotate that little segment of the array.  In the process, everything moves up by one, including the end of the left segment (mid).

      left = first;  right = mid+1;
      // One extra check:  can we SKIP the merge?
      if ( x[mid].compareTo(x[right]) <= 0 )
         return;

      while (left <= mid && right <= last)
      {  // Select from left:  no change, just advance left
         if ( x[left].compareTo(x[right]) <= 0 )
            left++;
         // Select from right:  rotate [left..right] and correct
         else
         {  tmp = x[right];     // Will move to [left]
            System.arraycopy(x, left, x, left+1, right-left);
            x[left] = tmp;
            // EVERYTHING has moved up by one
            left++;  mid++;  right++;
         }
      }
      // Whatever remains in [right..last] is in place

Complexity- O(N ^2)
